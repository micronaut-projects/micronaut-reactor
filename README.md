[![Build Status](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-reactor/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-reactor/actions)

Micronaut Reactor adds support for [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) to a Micronaut 2.x application. If you are 
using Micronaut 1.x you do not need this module.

## Documentation

See the [Snapshot Documentation](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-reactor/snapshot/guide/) for the current development docs.

## Snapshots and Releases

Snaphots are automatically published to [JFrog OSS](https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/) using [Github Actions](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-reactor/actions).

See the documentation in the [Micronaut Docs](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#usingsnapshots) for how to configure your build to use snapshots.

Releases are published to JCenter and Maven Central via [Github Actions](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-reactor/actions).

A release is performed with the following steps:

* [Edit the version](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-reactor/edit/master/gradle.properties) specified by `projectVersion` in `gradle.properties` to a semantic, unreleased version. Example `1.0.0`
* [Create a new release](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-reactor/releases/new). The Git Tag should start with `v`. For example `v1.0.0`.
* [Monitor the Workflow](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-reactor/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease) to check it passed successfully.
* Celebrate!
